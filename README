===
Variable: NOGUI=yes/no
Description:
Specify if there is a desktop environment running or it's CLI only.
Meaning, is there a GUI or not by default on boot.
===
Variable: AUTORESTART=yes/no
Description:
Specify when "zypper needs-rebooting" returns that a reboot is needed,
should the system just immediately restart.
===
Variable: ALWAYSRESTART=yes/no
Description:
WARNING, do not set ALWAYSRESTART to yes if there is an enabled service 
running this script. The reason is, the machine will always reboot, on boot.
The only way to stop it is with a live usb I guess.
Set this only if run by a timer or manually!

There is an example service file for every script.
